Recent advances in multi-omics approaches have provided unprecedented insights into the pathophysiology of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and associated complications. Integrating genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, and metabolomics data has revealed a complex network of molecular alterations driving pancreatic β-cell dysfunction, insulin resistance, and systemic metabolic derangements. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified numerous loci linked to T2DM susceptibility, including variants affecting genes such as TCF7L2, KCNJ11, and PPARG, which modulate β-cell proliferation, insulin secretion, and lipid metabolism. Transcriptomic profiling of pancreatic islets from diabetic patients has demonstrated dysregulated expression of critical transcription factors, including PDX1, MAFA, and NKX6-1, accompanied by upregulation of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress markers such as ATF4, CHOP, and HSPA5. These changes correlate with impaired insulin granule biogenesis and secretory capacity, suggesting that ER stress-mediated apoptosis contributes significantly to β-cell loss. Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) has further elucidated cellular heterogeneity within pancreatic islets, identifying subpopulations of β-cells with reduced insulin transcript levels and altered metabolic signatures. Ligand–receptor interaction analyses predict enhanced paracrine signaling between stressed β-cells and infiltrating immune cells, including CD8+ T lymphocytes and macrophages, via CXCL10–CXCR3 and TNF–TNFRSF1A axes, potentially exacerbating local inflammation and β-cell apoptosis. Integrating these findings with serum metabolomics indicates perturbations in branched-chain amino acid catabolism, dysregulated fatty acid oxidation, and impaired ketone body utilization, implicating systemic metabolic stress as a driver of progressive insulin secretory failure. Moreover, alterations in gut microbiome-derived metabolites, such as short-chain fatty acids and bile acids, suggest a role for the gut–islet axis in modulating insulin sensitivity and immune responses. Proteomic analyses of plasma from T2DM patients reveal aberrant expression of inflammatory mediators, including interleukin-6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), and chemokines such as CCL2 and CXCL10, which may contribute to chronic low-grade inflammation and vascular dysfunction. Additionally, phosphoproteomic studies identify disrupted insulin signaling cascades, with altered phosphorylation states of AKT, IRS1, and GSK3β, correlating with reduced glucose uptake in peripheral tissues. Integration of these multi-omic layers using network-based approaches uncovers modules of co-regulated genes and proteins, linking ER stress, oxidative stress, and mitochondrial dysfunction with impaired insulin secretion and action. Emerging evidence highlights the interplay between epigenetic modifications and metabolic dysregulation in T2DM. DNA methylation profiling of pancreatic islets identifies hypermethylation at promoters of key β-cell genes, such as INS and PDX1, while histone acetylation and methylation patterns are altered at loci involved in glucose sensing and insulin secretion. Non-coding RNAs, including microRNAs (e.g., miR-375, miR-29a/b) and long non-coding RNAs, further modulate β-cell transcriptomes, influencing both survival and function under metabolic stress. Importantly, these epigenetic changes may be partially reversible, offering potential targets for therapeutic intervention. Functional studies using human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived β-like cells and organoid models enable experimental validation of multi-omic predictions. Exposure to hyperglycemic and lipotoxic conditions recapitulates observed transcriptomic and proteomic changes, including activation of ER stress and inflammatory pathways, confirming causative links between metabolic insults and β-cell dysfunction. CRISPR-based perturbations of candidate genes identified from GWAS and network analyses, such as TCF7L2 and SLC30A8, demonstrate their critical roles in insulin granule maturation and secretion, providing mechanistic insights into genotype-phenotype associations. Furthermore, metabolomic flux analyses reveal that impaired mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation in β-cells reduces ATP production, compromising glucose-stimulated insulin secretion. Perturbations in NAD+/NADH ratios and redox balance are associated with increased production of reactive oxygen species, triggering apoptotic signaling. Pharmacological interventions targeting mitochondrial function, such as small-molecule NAD+ boosters or antioxidants, partially restore β-cell metabolic fitness in vitro, supporting the concept of metabolic resilience as a therapeutic strategy. Systems biology approaches integrating multi-omic datasets facilitate the identification of patient-specific molecular signatures, enabling stratification into subtypes with distinct pathophysiological mechanisms. For instance, one subset of T2DM patients exhibits predominant β-cell failure with marked ER stress and inflammation, whereas another shows primary insulin resistance associated with dyslipidemia and adipose tissue dysfunction. These stratifications inform personalized therapeutic strategies, including targeted use of GLP-1 receptor agonists, SGLT2 inhibitors, and anti-inflammatory agents, potentially improving glycemic control and reducing complications. Recent studies also explore the crosstalk between immune and metabolic pathways, highlighting the role of tissue-resident macrophages, T cells, and innate lymphoid cells in modulating islet function. Multi-omic profiling identifies metabolic reprogramming of immune cells in diabetic individuals, with increased glycolysis and altered lipid metabolism driving pro-inflammatory phenotypes. Therapeutic modulation of immune metabolism, such as inhibition of mTOR or glycolytic enzymes, shows promise in restoring islet homeostasis and improving insulin secretion in preclinical models. Finally, integration of longitudinal multi-omic datasets with clinical phenotyping allows monitoring of disease progression and therapeutic response. Machine learning models trained on multi-omic features can predict the trajectory of β-cell decline, insulin resistance, and risk of complications such as nephropathy, retinopathy, and cardiovascular disease. These predictive models, combined with mechanistic insights, lay the foundation for next-generation precision medicine approaches in T2DM management.
