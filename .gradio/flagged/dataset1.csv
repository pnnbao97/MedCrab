"Furthermore, metabolomic flux analyses reveal that impaired mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation in β-cells reduces ATP production, compromising glucose-stimulated insulin secretion. Perturbations in NAD+/NADH ratios and redox balance are associated with increased production of reactive oxygen species, triggering apoptotic signaling. Pharmacological interventions targeting mitochondrial function, such as small-molecule NAD+ boosters or antioxidants, partially restore β-cell metabolic fitness in vitro, supporting the concept of metabolic resilience as a therapeutic strategy. Systems biology approaches integrating multi-omic datasets facilitate the identification of patient-specific molecular signatures, enabling stratification into subtypes with distinct pathophysiological mechanisms.
